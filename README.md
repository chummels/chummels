### Cameron Hummels

I'm a computational astrophysicist at [Caltech](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/).  I simulate how matter structures itself in the universe, how galaxies form and evolve, and how light propagates to us from distant quasars.  I am also really passionate about science outreach, organizing all of the public education events in Caltech Astro.
